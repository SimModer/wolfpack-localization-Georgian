## About Wolfpack
Wolfpack is a thrilling WWII submarine simulation where you and your crew navigate the deep seas, operating a U-boat to complete missions. For more details, check out the [official Wolfpack game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/490920/Wolfpack/).

## Project Overview
With the release of update 0.26, Wolfpack now supports community-driven translations. Our mission? To ensure players from all corners of the globe can experience Wolfpack in their native language. Join us on this journey to make the game accessible for everyone!

### Current Status
Currently, we’re focusing on translating the **menu** text. In update 0.27, we’ve added an experimental version where a game file is replaced, but don’t worry—this file will still be available as a backup here. Some translations may be missing or appear late in the menu, so please bear with us as we refine this process.

## How to Install
We’re working on a video tutorial to guide you through the installation process. Stay tuned!
